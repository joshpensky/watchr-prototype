  "description": "## What is *watchr*? For binge watchers and casual media consumers who want to better keep track all of the shows and movies they view, *watchr* is a media-tracking solution that tracks release dates and users’ progression through shows and movies. Unlike other media-tracking solutions like TVShowTime or Trakt.tv, *watchr* focuses on the social aspect of watching shows and movies, giving users the ability to recommend and challenge friends to binge series, all while receiving badges and awards for completing certain shows and movies, or winning challenges with friends.",
